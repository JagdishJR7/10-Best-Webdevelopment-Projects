        <h2 style="color: black;">A Perfect Parallax Website</h2>
        <p>Parallax is an effect that is used to create a sense of depth and movement in a 2D environment. It is
            commonly used in web design and can be achieved by having different layers of content move at different
            speeds as the user scrolls through the page.</p>
        <p>An example of a parallax effect might be a website where the background image moves more slowly than the
            content in the foreground, creating the illusion of depth. As the user scrolls down the page, the background
            appears to move more slowly than the content, giving the impression that the content is closer and the
            background is further away.</p>
